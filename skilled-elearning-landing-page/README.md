### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://64c3ae2b035c7b65a62f733f--gleaming-baklava-73fb0a.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

### What I learned

Review basics of flexbox and grid.

I used to set "javascript:void" for dummy anchor URL.
But it's possible to make dummy anchor link by just removing href attribute.
Though it doesn't make pointer link on hover, so finally I decided to use "javascript:void".

I learned picture element is useful for setting multiple responsive images.

### Continued development

I wish to learn how to make hero image responsive more properly.
